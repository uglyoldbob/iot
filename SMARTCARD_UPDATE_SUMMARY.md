#### Certificate Authority Integration
- **CA Signing Card** - Dedicated card for certificate authority operations
- **User Certificate Card** - Separate card for end-user certificate operations
- **Intermediate CA Support** - Multiple cards representing different CA hierarchy levels

### 3. Enhanced Examples

2. **SSH Key Operations** - Shows personal vs. work SSH key separation using different cards
3. **Card Management Demo** - Comprehensive demonstration of all card management features
4. **Interactive CLI** - Enhanced CLI with full card management commands

#### Simulation Demo
- **Pure Simulation Mode** - Demonstrates all features without requiring Java simulator
- **Visual Workflow Demonstration** - Step-by-step visualization of card operations
- **Real-World Scenarios** - Shows practical use cases for card insertion/removal

## Technical Implementation

### Rust Integration (`examples/smartcard_integration.rs`)

```rust
// New card management operations
pub fn create_virtual_card(&self, card_name: &str) -> Result<String, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn insert_card(&self, card_id: &str) -> Result<bool, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn remove_card(&self) -> Result<bool, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn delete_virtual_card(&self, card_id: &str) -> Result<bool, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn is_card_inserted(&self) -> Result<bool, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn get_current_card_id(&self) -> Result<Option<String>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn get_virtual_card_ids(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
pub fn get_card_status(&self) -> Result<CardStatus, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>
```

### Java Simulator Integration

The Java smart card simulator already supports:
- Virtual card creation and management
- Card insertion/removal simulation
- Multiple card support
- Card state persistence
- CLI interface for interactive operations

### Enhanced CLI Interface

New CLI commands added:
1. Create virtual card
2. Insert card (with selection from available cards)
3. Remove card
4. Delete virtual card (with selection from available cards)
5. Get card status (comprehensive status display)
6-10. Standard operations (key generation, signing, etc.) with card presence checks

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. Multi-Environment Development
- **Development Card** - Lower security, rapid prototyping
- **Testing Card** - Intermediate security, testing scenarios
- **Production Card** - High security, production operations

### 2. Certificate Authority Hierarchies
- **Root CA Card** - Highly secured root certificate authority operations
- **Intermediate CA Card** - Intermediate certificate authority operations
- **End Entity Card** - User and device certificate operations

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- **Administrator Card** - Full administrative privileges
- **Operator Card** - Limited operational access
- **User Card** - End-user certificate operations

### 4. SSH Key Management
- **Personal SSH Card** - Personal development and access
- **Work SSH Card** - Corporate access with higher security requirements
- **Service SSH Card** - Automated service authentication

## Security Benefits

### 1. Isolation
- **Key Separation** - Different keys stored on different virtual cards
- **Role Isolation** - Operations restricted to appropriate card types
- **Environment Separation** - Development/test/production key isolation

### 2. Auditability
- **Card Usage Tracking** - Monitor which cards are used for which operations
- **Operation Logging** - Enhanced logging with card context
- **Access Control** - Fine-grained control over card access

### 3. Compliance
- **Regulatory Requirements** - Support for compliance frameworks requiring key separation
- **Security Policies** - Enforcement of organizational security policies
- **Audit Trails** - Complete audit trails of card usage and operations

## Files Modified/Added
